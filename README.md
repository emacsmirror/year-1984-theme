### 📚 Background on Apple Beige

The early Macintosh models (128K, 512K, early Plus) used a custom beige paint based on Pantone 453, designed by Jerry Manock 
and Apple’s early industrial design team.  

This hue, sometimes referred to as “putty,” predated Apple’s later shift to the cooler “Platinum” gray in 1987.
Over time, thanks to UV exposure, the plastic shells aged into a more yellowish tone—but the intended design was a soft neutral beige 
that blended into office surroundings of the era.
